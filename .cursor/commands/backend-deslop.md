# Remove AI code slop

Review the diff against main for this backend code (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Supabase/Postgres) and rewrite it so it looks like senior, idiomatic code consistent with existing modules. Remove or refactor patterns typical of AI-generated snippets and bring everything in line with the project’s established architecture and style.​

You must:

Remove verbose or tutorial-style comments/docstrings that simply restate function names or obvious behavior, keeping only comments that add real context in the project’s usual style.​

Eliminate redundant validations and overly defensive try/except blocks when invariants are already enforced by Pydantic models, FastAPI routing, or upstream callers.​

Align SQLAlchemy usage with existing patterns for session creation, transaction handling, and query style; do not recreate engines/sessions inline if the project already provides factories or dependencies.​

Normalize how Supabase/Postgres is accessed so it matches the rest of the codebase (e.g. reuse shared clients, connection settings, and error handling rather than doc-style boilerplate).​

Remove unused helpers, placeholder endpoints, sample data, and generic CRUD scaffolding that look like tutorial or autogenerated code.

At the end, output only a 1–3 sentence summary of the main categories of changes you made to make the code more idiomatic and less AI-like.
