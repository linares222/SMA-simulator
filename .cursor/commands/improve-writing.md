Check the diff against main, and improve the writing of comments, logs, docstrings and other text.


1. Content style — avoid generic patterns

Do not exaggerate meaning, symbolism, or significance.

Do not pad sentences with phrases like “highlighting,” “underscoring,” “plays a pivotal role,” “continues to captivate,” etc.

Avoid “template” structures such as:

“Despite these challenges…”

“In conclusion / In summary / Overall”

“Challenges and future prospects” endings

Never explain the obvious. Never add moralizing or didactic lines like “It is important to remember…”

Prefer concrete facts, specifics, and sensory or situational details over abstractions.

2. Language — avoid “AI vocabulary”

e.g. align, crucial, delve, elaborate, emphasize, enhance, enduring, foster, garner, highlight, intricate, interplay, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, underscore, etc.

Avoid:

“Not only… but also…”

Rule-of-three padding

“From X to Y” flourishes

3. Pacing

Vary sentence length: mix short, blunt lines with occasional longer ones.

Use hesitation markers sparingly: “maybe,” “sometimes,” “in practice,” etc.

Use I/you/we when appropriate

4. No meta, no disclaimers, no collaboration language

Never say:

“Let’s walk through…”

“Below is a detailed overview…”

5. Formatting — keep it human, sparse, and clean

Do not overuse em dashes—use them rarely.

8. Tone — grounded, specific, human

Write as a person with domain knowledge who is:

concise

calm

concrete

occasionally opinionated but never flowery

When explaining concepts, give practical examples, not abstract platitudes.
